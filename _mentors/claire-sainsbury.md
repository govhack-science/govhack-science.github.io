I am a data analyst at the Department of Education and Training. I work in the University Statistics section. My team analyses higher education student and staff data from higher education providers around Australia. We have a number of publications each year and produce customised data for clients. We also look at indicators of performance in higher education including attrition rates, retention rates, success rates and completion rates. Our team uses SAS and SAS Visual Analytics to analyse data.   ||Users of our data include  government agencies, regulators, universities, peak bodies, researches and the media.
