## **People**

There are over 2000 people who  participate in GovHack in some way including volunteers, participants, government representatives, technical mentors and are fabulous GovHack event organisers.  Participants hail  from all walks of life and bring a mish mash of diversity and amazingness to the event! 

## **Teams**

We expect that you will be part of a team already, or will join a team at the start of the competition. You are allowed to compete as an individual, but we highly recommend you find other awesome people and join a team. There is no maximum size for a team. The best teams have a mix of skill sets. If you don’t have a team, find a local crew member who will help you meet other GovHackers looking for a team.

if you don’t have a team then can come to the GovHack Connections event in your state to connect with other like minded participants to form a team. GovHack connections event will be held early July, details will be released soon.

## **Wellbeing at GovHack**

Taking care of yourself sounds pretty basic, but it’s surprisingly easy to forget over an intense 46 hours at a hackathon. Here are a few glaringly obvious things to bear in mind.

* Try not to get too stressed. (It helps to set realistic expectations, and to focus on having something ready to demo – perfectionism and feature creep aren’t your friends at a hackathon. And don’t forget to back-up your work, to avoid any last-minute panic.)

* Stretch!

* Make sure you eat and drink regularly, and not just caffeinated drinks. Hydration is important.

* Take breaks, go outside in the sunshine, tune out the world with headphones.

* Meal breaks are the perfect time to take a real break and also make new friends or get fresh air

* Remember to take any medication that you need.

* Try to get plenty of sleep. (We don’t recommend being that person who works all night and doesn’t sleep. This recommendation may be based on real life experience.)

## **Photography, video and audio recording**

GovHack is subject to extensive recording in video, audio and photographic form. By attending, you acknowledge and accept that you may be the subject of such recording, which may be shared through digital media in relation to GovHack events. We will seek to accommodate any specific wish not to be recorded, but cannot guarantee you will not be recorded in some form.

## **Social media**

Twitter will be the primary social media platform that will be used and monitored throughout the event.

Questions, comments, mentions, and cat GIFs can be directed to the National GovHack Twitter account, or to your local GovHack event account.

## **Public transport**

Consult your [local event](http://www.govhack.org/locations/) for information on getting there on public transport.

### **Parking**

Consult your [local event](http://www.govhack.org/locations/) for information on parking.

### **Security and building access**

Consult your [local event](http://www.govhack.org/locations/) for information on venue opening hours.

Volunteers will be onsite for every hour of the event. After hours, the building will be locked. A phone number will be placed at the entry to the venue if you have trouble gaining access.

Neither the event organisers nor venue operators can accept responsibility for personal belongings left unattended onsite. If you don’t have a trusted person to look after your belongings, we recommend taking them with you if you leave the venue.

## **Occupational health and safety**

OH&S refers to the policies, procedures, legislations and activities, which aim to protect the health and safety of people within a workplace. Specific ways to limit hazards to yourself or another person whilst participating in GovHack are listed below.

* It is imperative that your health and safety is never compromised.

* If you have any existing injuries, inform a volunteer

* If you notice any hazards, report them immediately to a volunteer (e.g. water spillages)

* Minimise the risk of tripping by getting a volunteer to place gaffer tape over cords, securing them to the floor

* Place tables and electrical items close to the power outlets whenever possible

* Bend your knees when you lift

* If you start to shake, put on some warmer clothes and/or slow down on the coffee/Red Bull

### **Think before you lift!**

Manual handling occurs when you are lifting, lowering, pushing, pulling, carrying, moving, holding, and restraining any person or thing. It’s unlikely you’ll have to lift anything heavy at this event – do you really need to be moving that? Check with a GovHack volunteer before moving anything larger than a laptop.

### **First aid**

If a person is unconscious or requires an ambulance, immediately dial 000.

### **Emergency procedures**

Details of emergency procedures will be introduced to participants during induction and on display within the venue. Make yourself familiar with these procedures at any time you’re onsite.
