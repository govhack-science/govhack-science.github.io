You have only approximately 46 hours to get your entry completed, so here is a guide as to how you might want to allocate your time. This is only a guide, and you can do whatever you want to create and submit your entry.

#### **Friday**

At 7pm on the Friday night the competition categories are launched and your team can start creating. The first night is all about working together in your team to create an idea. 

* Find a spot to set up and make your own for the weekend.

* Talk to mentors! They know the data and will have great ideas to get your started. 

* Head to the [hackerspace](http://2016.govhack.org) and register as a user and create a team page.This will unlock all the prize categories you can enter at your location including international, national, state and local prize.

* Spend some time  

    * reviewing prizes to identify some common themes of prize categories

    * reviewing the [Official data](http://portal.govhack.org/datasets.html) list which includes featured data from sponsors and open government data portals

    * Identify the focus of your investigation and project 

* Choose  similar prize categories to focus your energy on 

* Check if these prize categories have data requirements

* Assign roles within your team - working with each other strengths.

* Deconstruct the prize category

    * Think outside the box - entries can be anything a game, an art installation,  a visual display, a story, a gadget,a board game, analytical models, a data vis and of course some great apps   Is there new technology you want to try.  Judges reward originality and ideas that make data accessible to understand.

    *  Who are the users at the centre of your design

    * what pain points you could resolve

    * What other data could be relevant to the pain points or users?

    * Mind map your ideas

* Rule out data that needs too much work

* Create an evidence repository and add this URL to you Hackerspace project page. Start adding content even if it just photos of your workings for now (what is an evidence repository? - Github for the techies and Google folder/doc or similar that you can share via a URL is good for non-techies).

* Record Urls of datasets you use for submitting on your project page

* Ask for help :) 

**Saturday**

Aim to lock down your concept by midday Saturday. 

Mentors arrive at 9am to midday.  

* It's ok if you don't have an idea yet - the mentors will have loads of ideas and problems they want solved.  

* Road test your ideas with mentors and pick their brain.  Road test ideas with other participants

* Ask your govhack crew to help connect with mentors for ideas if you need

* Consolidate your many ideas into one or two good ones

* Data data data  - how will you use it, mash it interpret it ?- remember to record URLs of data in hackerspace project page

* Start a storyboard of how you will communicate your ideas

* What could you create/prototype/design/model  that is achievable and will help people understand the concept?  

* Take some photos of your team or media that will help your Vid entry

* Submit team registration page and nominate prize categories by 5pm deadline!

* No more project pages can be created after 5pm.

* Test and refine the entry

* Keep building

* Run your storyboard past some Govhack crew - 

**Sunday**

Last years competitors will all tell you the same… "it took me all arvo to create my Vid and then we had loading problems… Aggghh Panic!" On average it takes about an hour to load vids on YouTube and new technology when you're stressed takes twice as long as you want… so factor these elements into your days plans.

* Set tasks and activities for the day

* Research tools you will need for the day - check the [Handbook](http://www.2016.govhack.org)

* Finalise your storyboard script. What material will feature in your video? People? Places? Prototypes? Data? -  what are the key points or features you want judges to understand?  

* Build, prototype or mock up items that will feature in the vid  to demonstrate your concept.   

* Update your project page with your data story and datasets

* Script for your video

* Arrange for a quiet space to record any audio - aim for midday 

* Craft  and edit your 3 minute pitch video 

* Apply audio

* Load video to youtube or vimeo - write down URL of video while it loads - add the url to your hackerspace project page

* and upload to your team page

* By 2pm you should be in editing mode for your vid

* Get your team page completed to meet all entry criteria

* Aim to start loading your vid to YouTube (or similar) by no later than 4pm

* YouTube gives you a URL link as soon as you start loading your vid – so make sure you grab this and enter it on your project page

* Finish and submit entry by 5pm.

In order to get some sleep and quality coding time, you may want to consider organising your team into shifts, so that while some are working, others can go home and rest, and then take over to allow the previous shift to get some rest.

Don’t forget to look after yourself: take breaks, eat, drink and go for an occasional walk. Allow some time to get away and freshen up. Showers clear the mind!

**Top Tips:**

* Check the Eligibility criteria on each prize category - some prizes require you to use data from a specific data portal or dataset.

* Don’t try to develop concepts that win every prize, focus on complementary  prize categories.  

* Good ideas need sleep - aim for 7 hours minimum on the friday night as Saturday will be a long day!
