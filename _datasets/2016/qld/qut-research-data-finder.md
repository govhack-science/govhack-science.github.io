Research Data Finder is QUT's discovery service for research data created or collected by QUT researchers. Designed to promote the visibility of QUT research datasets, Research Data Finder provides descriptions about shareable, reusable datasets available via open or mediated access.

Interlinked web pages explicitly connect descriptive information about data collections, researchers or research groups, publications and projects. Users can link from a dataset description to a profile of one of its owners; from there, research projects that the data owner is a participant in can also be found.
