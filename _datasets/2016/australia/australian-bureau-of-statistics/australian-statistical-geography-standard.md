The ABS provides geospatial web services for the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) regions.

<!--more-->

This includes the ABS Structures, areas defined by the ABS, and Non-ABS Structures, areas not designed by the ABS but approximated using areas from the ASGS Main Structure.

You can find a complete listing of all available services in the [ABS Geospatial Web Services User Guide, 2015](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/1470.0main+features22015).

It should be noted that areas in the ASGS (and other boundaries) help us group statistical data into understandable areas without compromising privacy and confidentiality.

If you are looking for a way to show where people live (alongside the regions your data maps to), consider using the [Australian Population Grid, 2011](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/1270.0.55.007main+features12011), our finest level of detail on where Australians live and work.
