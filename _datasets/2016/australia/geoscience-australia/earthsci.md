EarthSci is an Eclipse RCP platform for creating applications for the visualisation of earth science data. It is an evolution of the existing [GA World Wind Suite](https://github.com/ga-m3dv/ga-worldwind-suite) built on the [NASA World Wind Java SDK](http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/java/).

The vision for EarthSci is to take the best features of the [GA World Wind Suite](https://github.com/ga-m3dv/ga-worldwind-suite) (Geological model support, WMS/WFS support, tiled data preparation, keyframe animation etc.) and combine them with the best features of the Eclipse platform (modular plugin architecture, in-built help, native windowing, model-based UI) to create a flexible platform with powerful science visualisation features. As development progresses more and more features will be added.

For more information on the project, see the [Wiki](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/earthsci/wiki).
