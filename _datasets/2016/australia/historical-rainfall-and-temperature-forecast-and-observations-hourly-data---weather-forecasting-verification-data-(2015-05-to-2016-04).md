Historical rainfall and temperature forecast and observations hourly data (2015-05 to 2016-04), used to compare and verify forecasting. Observations data is from a sample of 518 AWS stations over land, and is at the surface level. Data has been aggregated from one-minute readings into hourly values, for forecast comparison purposes. This observations data is partly QC'd.

Forecasted weather elements include temperature, maximum and minimum temperature, rainfall probabilities and rainfall amounts. Different forecast products have different time resolutions, e.g. temperature forecasts are made for each hour, while maximum and minimum temperature forecasts are made for each day.
