Geoscape is PSMA's award-winning new initiative to capture Australia's built environment and anchor it in a reliable geospatial base. The dataset will include 3D building attributes, land cover and tree heights. Geoscape also captures features such as roof materials, swimming pools and solar panels.

Our first capture phase covering 16,500 square kilometres in the Adelaide region has been completed and we are now excited to make a sample of data available for download. 

The Geoscape Evaluation Dataset comprises a 25 square kilometre area approximately 5 kilometres south/south west of Adelaide's central business district. This covers an area that is entirely 'urban' and takes in 25 suburbs. This area also includes a reasonable proportion of buildings with solar panels and properties with swimming pools.

To release this data for GovHack16 under a CCBY-NC licence, we have had to remove the values for maximum [building] height, eave height and roof shape type and the trees layer.
