The Intellectual Property Government Open Data (IPGOD) includes over 100 years of Intellectual Property (IP) rights administered by IP Australia comprising patents, trade marks, designs and plant breeder's rights. The data is highly detailed, including information on each aspect of the application process from application through to granting of IP rights. We have published a paper to accompany IPGOD which describes the data and illustrates its use, as well as a technical paper on the firm matching. Links to these papers can be found in the Data Dictionary.
