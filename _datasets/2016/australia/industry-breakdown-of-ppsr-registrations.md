This dataset was specially created by AFSA for GovHack 2016. It contains the number of new registrations on the PPSR by ANZSIC industry division and subdivision.

AFSA sourced the Industry information from the Australian Business Register (ABR). To do this, AFSA used the Australian Company Number (ACN) to match records. To protect privacy, AFSA assigned each ACN a random number instead of showing the actual ACN.

This data is a subset of overall PPSR registrations created. It solely includes registrations created by organisational secured parties that have registered on the PPSR with an ACN.
