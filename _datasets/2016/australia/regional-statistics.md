AFSA do not publish data with small numbers of individuals. Whenever necessary to suppress data, cells are marked ‘data not available’. Generally, AFSA publish data with three or more debtors.

Addresses that are not in the ASGS are reported as 'Other (not in ASGS)' for each state and territory. This includes debtors who: a) have no fixed address, b) have not lodged a statement of affairs, or c) reported an overseas address.
