The Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric (Geofabric) is a specialised Geographic Information System (GIS). It identifies the spatial relationships of important hydrological features such as rivers, lakes, reservoirs, dams, canals and catchments.

By detailing the spatial dimensions of these features, models can be developed to show how water is stored, transported and used through the landscape.

In Geofabric V2.1.1 there are 6 products available:
Hydrology Cartography
Hydrology Network
Hydrology Catchments
Hydrology Reporting Catchments
