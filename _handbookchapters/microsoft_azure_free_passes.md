## What is Microsoft Azure

What is Azure? In short, it’s Microsoft’s cloud platform: a growing collection of integrated services—compute, storage, data, networking, and app—that help you move faster, do more, and save money. But that’s just scratching the surface.

From App Services, Machine Learning, Mobile Engagement and more. Here’s a list of what you get as part of [Azure for FREE](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/pricing-offers/). 

## It’s IaaS + PaaS

Azure is the only major cloud platform ranked by Gartner as an industry leader for both infrastructure-as- a-service (IaaS) and platform-as- a-service (PaaS). This powerful combination of managed and unmanaged services lets you build, deploy, and manage applications any way you like for unmatched productivity.

## It’s hybrid ready

With Azure, data storage, backup, and recovery become more efficient and economical. It’s also easier to build applications that span both on-premises and the cloud. 

## It’s open and flexible

Azure supports any operating system, language, tool, and framework— from Windows to Linux, SQL Server to Oracle, C# to Java. It puts the best of Windows and Linux ecosystems at your fingertips.

## It’s always up, always on

You’ll share the same enterprise-tested platform that powers Skype, Office 365, Bing, and Xbox. Azure offers a 99.95% availability SLA, 24x7 tech support, and round-the- clock service health monitoring. That’s why more than 57% of Fortune 500 companies rely on Azure today. From live streaming Olympic events to online multiplayer online games, our customers are doing some amazing things.

## It’s economical and scalable

Azure can quickly scale up or down to match demand, so you only pay for what you use.

## It’s everywhere

Azure runs on a growing global network of Microsoft-managed datacenters across 13 regions.
