## What’s  can i submit as a Hack

## A Hack is when you take something and make it better! This is an open data competition so you need to reuse official open data in a clever and creative way.  

Entries could include, art, jewellery, a digital sign, a board game,  historic film pieces, a virtual reality game, internet of things (IOT), a digital sensor display, a 3D model, a visualisation of data, an informed article and of course some amazing web apps! We only limit you to your imagination.

Prize categories can help provide inspiration to shape your ideas, as can mentors sop don't be afraid to tap into the resources on hand for ideas.

It's only 46 hours, so many of concepts entered are prototypes, mock ups,  models, smaller scale artworks and even engineering design concepts from our maker community.   Of course we have had some very crafty teams deliver live apps within the time frame. Your proof of concepts should be showcased in someway in your  3 minute video submission.

## Using Open Data

You will find the list of Official data available for the GovHack competition in the[ Official Datasets list](http://portal.govhack.org/datasets.html). You must use at least one Official dataset to be eligible for prizes.  Official Data includes individual datasets featured and all data discoverable on official Government data portals that are published on the Official Dataset list.

You will need to Record the URL of the most prominent data you have used on your Hackerspace project page. Remember judges love to see their data reused :)

For each prize category you enter, please check the eligibility requirements to see if any specific data  needs to be reused to meet judges criteria.  To maximize your chances to win National and Local prizes we recommend you mash up National and Local official data, giving you a chance in as many categories as possible.

Some datasets listed on data portals may have additional resources available with further information on how to use the data or other supporting material. You are encouraged to download and use these resources. 

Several competition goals require entries must use at least one of the datasets provided for this contest, but you are free to use data from the official GovHack list or other datasets as long as their licensing terms permit usage for this purpose. You may also use any publicly accessible web services as long as it does not incur a financial cost to use (private and subscription APIs are prohibited due to licensing issues and barrier to entry).

## Eligibility for Prizes

A team can be one person or more.  We recommend teams that are 3 to 6  people is best. 

To be eligible for prizes, individual entrants must be either an Australian or New Zealand citizen or a current Australian or New Zealand resident (this includes temporary student residents). It’s only fair – it is an Australian and New Zealand GovHack competition after all.  

At least one team member must be over 18 (Or a guardian must be registered as the Representative to facilitate prizes). 

For all Virtual Team competitors you must be a resident of the state or territory to participate and have one team member who has attended an event over the competition weekend.

Judges expect entries to be primarily developed throughout the weekend of GovHack. If submissions are shown to have been worked on before the weekend, the submission will be ineligible for prizes. This does not include reuse or extension of existing software, libraries or data sets. Entrants may be members of multiple teams but each team must be registered separately and each team has one entry. There is no maximum team size.

No judges will be eligible to compete for prizes, and individuals from organisations or companies are also not eligible for prizes sponsored by their organisation. Mentors/speakers are eligible to compete for prizes, but judges reserve the right to disqualify a mentor/speaker if they perceive unfairness.
