[Hackathons Australia](http://www.hackathonsaustralia.com) is proud to hold GovHack Sydney, a 2 day event to innovate and prototype using open government data. 

We are encouraging and celebrating our technical and creative capacity, connecting citizens with government for great outcomes, and building upon the social and economic value of open data published by government.

Come to connect with like minded people, make a difference to the community and create useful solutions!

There'll be delicious food (did someone mention Messina..?), incredible cash prizes, and amazing mentors to help you along the way.
